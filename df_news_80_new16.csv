business,"Ad sales boost Time Warner profit

Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.

The firm, which is now one of the biggest investors in Google, benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.

Time Warner said on Friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine Google. But its own internet business, AOL, had has mixed fortunes. It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL's existing customers for high-speed broadband. TimeWarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), which is close to concluding.

Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. ""Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,"" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.

TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators. It has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges, in a deal that is under review by the SEC. The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves, which it previously set at $500m. It intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann's purchase of a stake in AOL Europe, which it had reported as advertising revenue. It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as a loss on the value of that stake.

business,"Dollar gains on Greenspan speech

The dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.

And Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government's willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan's speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. ""I think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time,"" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. ""He's taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.""

Worries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing's policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the ""time is ripe"" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve's decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.

business,"Yukos unit buyer faces loan claim

The owners of embattled Russian oil giant Yukos are to ask the buyer of its former production unit to pay back a $900m (£479m) loan.

State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos. Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets. Rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks. Legal experts said Rosneft's purchase of Yugansk would include such obligations. ""The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets,"" said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case. Menatep Group's managing director Tim Osborne told the Reuters news agency: ""If they default, we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit.""

Rosneft officials were unavailable for comment. But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk. Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale.

This adds to a $540 million repayment claim from foreign banks already facing Rosneft.

business,"High fuel prices hit BA's profits

British Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits.

Reporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of £75m ($141m) compared with £125m a year earlier. Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said the results were ""respectable"" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%. BA's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.

To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.

In October, it increased this from £6 to £10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from £2.50 to £4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to £1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. ""For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,"" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.

It also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA's latest quarterly results as ""pretty modest"". ""It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,"" he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. ""Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,"" Mr Eddington said. ""For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds."" BA's shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.

business,"Pernod takeover talk lifts Domecq

Shares in UK drinks and food firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by France's Pernod Ricard.

Reports in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times suggested that the French spirits firm is considering a bid, but has yet to contact its target. Allied Domecq shares in London rose 4% by 1200 GMT, while Pernod shares in Paris slipped 1.2%. Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.

Pernod's last major purchase was a third of US giant Seagram in 2000, the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms. The other two-thirds of Seagram was bought by market leader Diageo. In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of £5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros). Last year Pernod tried to buy Glenmorangie, one of Scotland's premier whisky firms, but lost out to luxury goods firm LVMH. Pernod is home to brands including Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, Havana Club rum and Jacob's Creek wine. Allied Domecq's big names include Malibu rum, Courvoisier brandy, Stolichnaya vodka and Ballantine's whisky - as well as snack food chains such as Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream. The WSJ said that the two were ripe for consolidation, having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio. Pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the Seagram purchase to just 1.8bn euros, while Allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains.

business,"Japan narrowly escapes recession

Japan's economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to September, figures show.

Revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter. On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.

The government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. ""I maintain the view that Japan's economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully,"" said economy minister Heizo Takenaka. But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine. ""It's painting a picture of a recovery... much patchier than previously thought,"" said Paul Sheard, economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. Improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand, with private consumption up just 0.2% in the third quarter.

business,"Jobs growth still slow in the US

The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.

According to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year's election. However, when adding December and January's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory.

The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.

Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. ""It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,"" said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. ""We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment."" ""The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,"" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. ""That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.""

The Labor Department also revised December’s job growth down to 133,000 from 157,000. Taken together, December and January were just enough to nudge President Bush’s first-term job record into marginally positive territory after having been negative through last November’s election, when employment was a central campaign issue. Economists characterized the trend as moderate rather than robust, noting that hiring has not matched what might be expected amid a weak dollar and relatively low interest rates. Analysts said the pace creates limited new opportunities for workers, signaling steady but unspectacular momentum in employment despite generally favorable economic conditions.","The US economy added only 146,000 non-farm payroll jobs in January, falling short of the expected 190,000, according to Labor Department data. Despite the shortfall, a decline in jobseekers lowered the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest since September 2001. This modest gain enabled President Bush to claim a net job increase over his first term, reversing a net loss that persisted until the November 2004 election—the first such decline since Herbert Hoover. Job creation was a pivotal issue in the campaign. The department also revised December 2004 job gains downward from 157,000 to 133,000.

The Labor Department also revised December payroll growth down to 133,000 from 157,000. The modest gain allows President Bush to claim, by a narrow margin, net job creation over his first term when December and January are included, after previously presiding over a net job loss through last November’s election — the first such outcome since Hoover. Economists said hiring remains moderate given supportive conditions such as a weak dollar and still-low interest rates. BMO’s Rick Egelton said employment is expanding at a “moderate” pace, while ClearView Economics’ Ken Mayland called the gains “not satisfying,” citing limited new opportunities. Overall, the figures point to steady but subdued labor-market momentum.","In January, the U.S. economy added only 146,000 jobs, falling short of the 190,000 expected by markets. Despite the slower-than-anticipated growth, the unemployment rate declined to 5.2%, its lowest level in three years, primarily due to a decrease in the number of people actively seeking employment.

This modest job creation, combined with a downwardly revised 133,000 jobs for December, was politically significant. It narrowly pushed the net job growth during President Bush's first term into positive territory, a crucial outcome after job creation became a key issue in the presidential election. Previously, he was on track to be the first president since Herbert Hoover to oversee a net job loss.

Analysts described the employment growth as ""moderate"" and less robust than expected given favorable economic conditions, such as low interest rates and a weak dollar.","January's US job growth significantly underperformed expectations, with only 146,000 jobs added—a figure falling short of the projected 190,000.  Despite this shortfall, the unemployment rate dropped to 5.2%, its lowest point in over three years, primarily due to a decrease in the number of job seekers.  This modest job growth, coupled with a downward revision of December's figures (from 157,000 to 133,000), allowed the Bush administration to narrowly claim net job growth during his first term, a feat achieved despite job losses prior to the November 2004 election.  However, economists express concern that job creation remains insufficient given the current favorable economic climate, characterized by a weak dollar and low interest rates.  The slow pace of job growth suggests limited new opportunities for workers, indicating a moderate but unsatisfactory employment expansion.  The overall picture paints a mixed bag: while unemployment is down, the pace of job creation remains a cause for concern.

Analysts attribute this to factors hindering stronger job creation.  The December job gains were also revised down from 157,000 to 133,000. This positive job growth, albeit minimal, marks a turnaround for President Bush's first term, previously characterized by net job losses – a first for a US president since Herbert Hoover. The limited job creation, however, translates to restricted opportunities for workers, according to economic experts.  The overall situation indicates a continuing, yet underwhelming, pace of employment expansion within the US economy.

The report calculated emergency food requirements for 2005 to be 387,500 tonnes. On top of that, 89,000 tonnes of fortified blended food and vegetable oil for ""targeted supplementary food distributions for a survival programme for children under five and pregnant and lactating women"" will be needed.

In eastern and southern Ethiopia, a prolonged drought has killed crops and drained wells. Last year, a total of 965,000 tonnes of food assistance was needed to help seven million Ethiopians. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) recommend that the food assistance is bought locally. ""Local purchase of cereals for food assistance programmes is recommended as far as possible, so as to assist domestic markets and farmers,"" said Henri Josserand, chief of FAO's Global Information and Early Warning System. Agriculture is the main economic activity in Ethiopia, representing 45% of gross domestic product. About 80% of Ethiopians depend directly or indirectly on agriculture.

business,"Court rejects $280bn tobacco case

A US government claim accusing the country's biggest tobacco companies of covering up the effects of smoking has been thrown out by an appeal court.

The demand for $280bn (£155bn) - filed by the Clinton administration in 1999 - was rejected in a 2-1 decision. The court in Washington found that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. In its case, the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction, targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns, lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.

Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to surrender $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. But the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the US government could not sue the firms under legislation drawn up to counteract Mafia infiltration of business. The tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public. They also say they have already met many of the government's demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998. Shares of tobacco companies closed higher after the ruling, with Altria rising 5% and Reynolds showing gains of 4.5%.

business,"Ask Jeeves tips online ad revival

Ask Jeeves has become the third leading online search firm this week to thank a revival in internet advertising for improving fortunes.

The firm's revenue nearly tripled in the fourth quarter of 2004, exceeding $86m (£46m). Ask Jeeves, once among the best-known names on the web, is now a relatively modest player. Its $17m profit for the quarter was dwarfed by the $204m announced by rival Google earlier in the week. During the same quarter, Yahoo earned $187m, again tipping a resurgence in online advertising.

The trend has taken hold relatively quickly. Late last year, marketing company Doubleclick, one of the leading providers of online advertising, warned that some or all of its business would have to be put up for sale. But on Thursday, it announced that a sharp turnaround had brought about an unexpected increase in profits. Neither Ask Jeeves nor Doubleclick thrilled investors with their profit news, however. In both cases, their shares fell by some 4%. Analysts attributed the falls to excessive expectations in some quarters, fuelled by the dramatic outperformance of Google on Tuesday.

business,"Indonesians face fuel price rise

Indonesia's government has confirmed it is considering raising fuel prices by as much as 30%.

Millions of Indonesians use kerosene for basic cooking, and prices have been heavily subsidised for years. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor. But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help. Millions of people were left homeless in Indonesia Aceh's region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late December.

Indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down. It spent 59.2 trillion rupiah ($6.58bn; £3.5bn) on fuel subsidies in 2004, a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah. Since President Yudhoyono's government came to power in October, it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies. ""The (January to March) quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices,"" said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, State Minister for National Development Planning. ""We are still considering if a 30% hike is suitable at the moment. The sooner the better for the state budget."" The BBC's correspondent in Jakarta, Rachel Harvey, told World Business Report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise. ""The big question is whether they go for one big, short, sharp shock and raise prices between 20% and 30% or whether they try to stagger it,"" she said. Indonesia's previous government, led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.

Soaring global oil prices caused subsidy costs to reach 59.2 trillion rupiah in 2004, drastically exceeding the initial budget. The administration plans to redirect the savings from cutting subsidies into aid programs for the poor.

However, the plan is controversial. Critics argue that increasing the price of essential fuels, like the kerosene used by millions for cooking, will disproportionately harm the low-income families the government intends to help. The government faces a significant risk of public backlash, as a similar attempt to cut subsidies in 2003 was abandoned after widespread protests forced a reversal.","Indonesia is grappling with a potential fuel price increase of up to 30%, a move driven by the unsustainable cost of fuel subsidies.  The government, aiming to redirect subsidy funds towards poverty alleviation programs, faces significant public backlash.  Millions rely on subsidized kerosene, and a price hike would disproportionately impact the poor, contradicting the government's stated goals.  The substantial subsidy expenditure, exceeding projections significantly in 2004, necessitates reform.  While the current administration considers a swift, substantial increase, the possibility of a phased approach remains.  Past attempts at subsidy cuts have met with widespread protests, highlighting the sensitive political climate surrounding this crucial economic decision. The timing, likely in the first quarter, is strategically chosen for budget management, but risks public unrest.  The government's commitment to assisting the poor is challenged by the potential negative consequences of this necessary, yet politically precarious, price adjustment.

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor. But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help. It spent 59.2 trillion rupiah ($6.58bn; £3.5bn) on fuel subsidies in 2004, a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah. ""The sooner the better for the state budget."" Indonesia's previous government, led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.","Indonesia is considering a fuel price increase of up to 30%, impacting millions who rely on heavily subsidized kerosene.  The government aims to redirect subsidy funds towards poverty alleviation programs, but critics fear this will disproportionately harm low-income families.  Higher global oil prices have significantly increased Indonesia's fuel subsidy costs, exceeding initial projections by a substantial margin.  A 30% hike is under consideration, with the government stating that implementing the increase sooner is preferable for the national budget.  Public protests are anticipated, raising concerns about the potential for social unrest, mirroring past attempts to reduce fuel subsidies. The timing and magnitude of the price increase remain key considerations for the government.

business,"Peugeot deal boosts Mitsubishi

Struggling Japanese car maker Mitsubishi Motors has struck a deal to supply French car maker Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV).

The two firms signed a Memorandum of Understanding, and say they expect to seal a final agreement by Spring 2005. The alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.

In January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Its sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. Last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; £2.77bn) in fresh financial backing, half of it from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm's troubles. Mitsubishi Motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March 2005. Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival Nissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan. It has been making cars for Nissan since 2003.

business,"Telegraph newspapers axe 90 jobs

The Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff.

The Telegraph Group says the cuts are needed to fund an £150m investment in new printing facilities. Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot.

Pearson's Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.

The National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. ""Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,"" said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. ""They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,"" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.

Some broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.

The Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. The Telegraph Group was bought by the Barclay twins - Frederick and David - last year, having previously been owned by Lord Conrad Black's Hollinger International. The brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses, retailer Littlewoods.

Telegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.

""Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital,"" he said. ""However, action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital."" Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page. They are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike. In recent months News Corp's News International unit, which publishes The Sun and the News of the World, the Guardian Media Group, Trinity Mirror and the Daily Mail & General Trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants.

business,"Air passengers win new EU rights

Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.

New EU rules set compensation at between 250 euros (£173) and 600 euros, depending on the length of the flight. The new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. The European Commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and the other from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has attacked the package as a ""bad piece of legislation"". Previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding.

However, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.

The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. Overbooking can often lead to 'bumping' - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. When this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.

However, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to ""extraordinary circumstances"". Airlines fear that ""extraordinary circumstances"" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday. Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. ""It's a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,"" Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told Radio 4's Today programme.

The European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.

EC spokeswoman Marja Quillinan-Meiland conceded there were ""grey areas"" but said ""these are not as big as the airlines are making out"". In cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said. New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. The ERAA's Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. ""We reckon it's going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers,"" Mr Clarke said. ""That's basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.""

On Wednesday, Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport, said that the changes were necessary. ""The boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers' right."" ""This is a concrete example of how the Union benefits people's daily lives,"" he added. The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.
","In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.However, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to ""extraordinary circumstances"".""We reckon it's going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers,"" Mr Clarke said.When this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation.All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday.The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights.Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.However, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket.The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added.",268.0,601.0,"New European Union rules that took effect Thursday grant air passengers stronger rights to compensation when they are denied boarding through overbooking, or when flights are cancelled or delayed. Compensation is set at €250 to €600 depending on route length, and now covers both scheduled and charter services, including low-cost carriers. Previously, only scheduled airlines had to compensate for overbooking—and not for cancellations—with payouts between €150 and €300.

Under the regime, airlines must compensate passengers involuntarily “bumped,” and all passengers on flights cancelled or delayed by more than two hours when the airline is at fault. Carriers are exempt when disruptions arise from “extraordinary circumstances,” though airlines argue the term is vague and may not clearly include bad weather, security alerts, or strikes. Disputes will be ruled on by national enforcement bodies. The rules apply to all EU-based airlines and to any flight departing the EU.

Airlines and industry groups have mounted legal challenges. The European Low-fare Airlines Association and the International Air Transport Association are contesting the legislation in court, calling it a bad law that will raise costs. Low-cost operators argue compensation could exceed ticket prices; Ryanair’s deputy chief executive labeled the policy “preposterous.” The European Regions Airline Association says the European Commission failed to consult carriers or consumers and warns costs will be passed on to travelers—estimating €1.5bn annually.

Air passengers in the European Union now have stronger protections against flight disruptions, with new rules mandating compensation for overbooking, cancellations, or delays. Effective from Thursday, payouts range from 250 euros (£173) to 600 euros, depending on flight distance, applying to all scheduled and charter flights, including low-cost carriers. This marks a significant increase from previous levels of 150-300 euros, which were limited to overbooking on scheduled flights and excluded cancellations.

The regulations aim to curb deliberate overbooking, which often results in ""bumping"" passengers to later flights. Compensation is required if passengers are involuntarily denied boarding or if flights are cancelled or delayed over two hours due to airline fault. However, exemptions apply for ""extraordinary circumstances"" beyond carriers' control, such as bad weather, security issues, or strikes—though airlines fear narrow interpretations could still hold them liable.

Airlines have fiercely opposed the changes, warning of higher ticket prices to offset costs. The European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) have launched legal challenges, labeling the legislation ""bad"" and ""preposterous."" Ryanair's deputy chief executive, Michael Cawley, criticized it on BBC Radio 4, arguing payouts could exceed ticket prices. The European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) claims inadequate consultation and estimates an annual 1.5 billion euros (£1 billion) burden on passengers, essentially redistributing funds from unaffected travelers to those disrupted. ERAA's Andy Clarke accused the European Commission (EC) of misleading consumers on weather-related liabilities.

The EC defends the rules as essential for protecting passengers amid booming air travel. Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot emphasized their role in enhancing daily life benefits from the EU. Spokeswoman Marja Quillinan-Meiland acknowledged ""grey areas"" but downplayed their scope, noting national bodies will resolve disputes and that technology aids operations in adverse conditions. To raise awareness, the EC has initiated an information campaign at airports and travel agencies.

(Word count: 312)","Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.New EU rules set compensation at between 250 euros (£173) and 600 euros, depending on the length of the flight.The new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines.Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost.The European Commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and the other from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has attacked the package as a ""bad piece of legislation"".Previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding.However, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights.Overbooking can often lead to 'bumping' - when a passenger is moved to a later flight.When this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation.In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.However, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to ""extraordinary circumstances"".Airlines fear that ""extraordinary circumstances"" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control.All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday.Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket.""It's a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,"" Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told Radio 4's Today programme.The European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes.Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.EC spokeswoman Marja Quillinan-Meiland conceded there were ""grey areas"" but said ""these are not as big as the airlines are making out"".In cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said.New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added.The ERAA's Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers.""We reckon it's going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers,"" Mr Clarke said.""That's basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.""On Wednesday, Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport, said that the changes were necessary.""The boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers' right.""""This is a concrete example of how the Union benefits people's daily lives,"" he added.The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.",0.8572048544883728,"The European Union has introduced strengthened air passenger rights, effective immediately, requiring airlines to provide higher, standardized compensation to travelers denied boarding due to overbooking or affected by cancellations and lengthy delays. Compensation is set at €250 to €600 per passenger depending on flight distance, a significant increase on the previous €150–€300 range, and now covers both scheduled and charter services, including budget carriers. The rules apply to all EU-based airlines and to any flight departing from the EU. The reforms aim to deter deliberate overbooking and mandate payouts when passengers are involuntarily “bumped.” They also require compensation when a flight is canceled or delayed for more than two hours and the delay is the airline’s fault. Airlines are exempt when “extraordinary circumstances” cause disruption, though carriers warn that the term’s scope is unclear and may not explicitly include bad weather, security alerts, or strikes. Low-cost airlines and industry groups have attacked the legislation, with the European Low-fare Airlines Association and the International Air Transport Association filing legal challenges and Ryanair calling the measure “preposterous,” arguing payouts could exceed ticket prices. The European Regions Airline Association says it was not properly consulted and estimates the rules will add €1.5bn annually to passenger costs, effectively shifting money from unaffected travelers to those disrupted. The European Commission acknowledges some “grey areas” but says national enforcement bodies will adjudicate disputes and notes that technology has improved operations in poor weather. Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot defended the changes as necessary consumer protection amid booming air travel, and the Commission has launched an information campaign at airports and travel agencies to publicize the new rights.","The European Union has implemented new legislation granting air passengers significantly enhanced compensation rights for flight disruptions. Under the new rules, passengers who are denied boarding due to overbooking or who experience cancellations or delays exceeding two hours are now entitled to claim between €250 and €600, depending on the flight's distance. This regulation applies universally to all scheduled and charter flights departing from EU airports, including budget airlines, expanding upon previous rules that offered lower compensation and were limited primarily to overbooking on scheduled flights. The EU's stated goal is to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking.

The airline industry has strongly condemned the legislation. Major industry bodies, including the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA), have launched legal challenges, labeling the rules a ""bad piece of legislation."" Airlines argue the increased financial burden will be passed to consumers through higher ticket prices, with the European Regions Airline Association estimating the annual cost to passengers at €1.5 billion. Critics, such as Ryanair's deputy chief executive, have called the measures ""preposterous,"" noting that compensation could exceed the original cost of a low-fare ticket.

A key point of contention is the ""extraordinary circumstances"" clause, which exempts airlines from payment. Airlines fear this exemption will not cover events beyond their control, such as bad weather or strikes. The European Commission (EC) concedes ""grey areas"" but maintains national bodies will resolve disputes and believes airlines are overstating the problem. Despite the backlash, the EC defends the changes as a necessary protection for passengers in a booming travel market and a tangible benefit of the Union for its citizens.","The European Union has implemented new regulations significantly increasing compensation for air passengers affected by overbooking, cancellations, or significant delays.  Compensation now ranges from €250 to €600 depending on flight length, applying to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget carriers. This surpasses the previous €150-€300 compensation and extends coverage to cancellations, previously uncompensated unless due to overbooking on scheduled flights.  The increased compensation aims to deter airlines from overbooking and ensure passenger protection.

However, the legislation faces legal challenges from the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), who criticize it as flawed and potentially inflationary.  Airlines argue the increased costs will necessitate higher ticket prices, estimating an additional €1.5 billion annual burden on European passengers.  Further contention surrounds the definition of ""extraordinary circumstances,"" exempting airlines from compensation, with concerns that it might exclude weather disruptions, security alerts, and strikes. The European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) also criticizes the lack of consultation with airlines and consumers and claims the EC's communication misleads passengers regarding compensation for weather-related delays.  Despite industry opposition, the European Commission maintains the changes are necessary to protect passengers' rights amidst the growth of air travel and has initiated an information campaign to raise awareness among passengers.  National enforcement bodies will resolve disputes arising from the new regulations.

Groups like the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA), the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and the European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) have launched legal challenges and criticized the regulations as flawed and economically burdensome.  They argue the ""extraordinary circumstances"" clause, exempting airlines from compensation in cases like bad weather or strikes, lacks clarity and that the increased compensation costs will inevitably be passed on to consumers, potentially amounting to over €1.5 billion annually.

Airlines contend the compensation levels are excessive, in some cases exceeding ticket prices, and claim the changes were implemented without sufficient consultation.  The European Commission, while acknowledging some ""grey areas,"" maintains that the new rules are necessary to protect passenger rights and that national enforcement bodies will resolve disputes.  Despite the industry's objections and concerns about increased costs, the new regulations are in effect, signifying a substantial shift in passenger rights within the EU.

business,"China keeps tight rein on credit

China's efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report.

The curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a ""hard landing"" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. Industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to October, down from 23% in February, and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail sales are still booming.

entertainment,"Gallery unveils interactive tree

A Christmas tree that can receive text messages has been unveiled at London's Tate Britain art gallery.

The spruce has an antenna which can receive Bluetooth texts sent by visitors to the Tate. The messages will be ""unwrapped"" by sculptor Richard Wentworth, who is responsible for decorating the tree with broken plates and light bulbs. It is the 17th year that the gallery has invited an artist to dress their Christmas tree. Artists who have decorated the Tate tree in previous years include Tracey Emin in 2002.

The plain green Norway spruce is displayed in the gallery's foyer. Its light bulb adornments are dimmed, ordinary domestic ones joined together with string. The plates decorating the branches will be auctioned off for the children's charity ArtWorks. Wentworth worked as an assistant to sculptor Henry Moore in the late 1960s. His reputation as a sculptor grew in the 1980s, while he has been one of the most influential teachers during the last two decades. Wentworth is also known for his photography of mundane, everyday subjects such as a cigarette packet jammed under the wonky leg of a table.

entertainment,"Jarre joins fairytale celebration

French musician Jean-Michel Jarre is to perform at a concert in Copenhagen to mark the bicentennial of the birth of writer Hans Christian Andersen.

Denmark is holding a three-day celebration of the life of the fairy-tale author, with a concert at Parken stadium on 2 April. Other stars are expected to join the line-up in the coming months, and the Danish royal family will attend. ""Christian Andersen's fairy tales are timeless and universal,"" said Jarre. ""For all of us, at any age there is always - beyond the pure enjoyment of the tale - a message to learn."" There are year-long celebrations planned across the world to celebrate Andersen and his work, which includes The Emperor's New Clothes and The Little Mermaid. Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary visited New York on Monday to help promote the festivities. The pair were at a Manhattan library to honour US literary critic Harold Bloom ""the international icon we thought we knew so well"".

""Bloom recognizes the darker aspects of Andersen's authorship,"" Prince Frederik said.

entertainment,"Musical treatment for Capra film

The classic film It's A Wonderful Life is to be turned into a musical by the producer of the controversial hit show Jerry Springer - The Opera.

Frank Capra's 1946 movie starring James Stewart, is being turned into a £7m musical by producer Jon Thoday. He is working with Steve Brown, who wrote the award-winning musical Spend Spend Spend. A spokeswoman said the plans were in the ""very early stages"", with no cast, opening date or theatre announced.

A series of workshops have been held in London, and on Wednesday a cast of singers unveiled the musical to a select group of potential investors. Mr Thoday said the idea of turning the film into a musical had been an ambition of his for almost 20 years. It's a Wonderful Life was based on a short story, The Greatest Gift, by Philip van Doren Stern. Mr Thoday managed to buy the rights to the story from Van Doren Stern's family in 1999, following Mr Brown's success with Spend Spend Spend. He later secured the film rights from Paramount, enabling them to use the title It's A Wonderful Life.

The 10 authors shortlisted for a Richard and Judy book award in 2005 are hoping for a boost in sales following the success of this year's winner.

entertainment,"Poppins musical gets flying start

The stage adaptation of children's film Mary Poppins has had its opening night in London's West End.

Sir Cameron Mackintosh's lavish production, which has cost £9m to bring to the stage, was given a 10-minute standing ovation. Lead actress Laura Michelle Kelly soared over the heads of the audience holding the nanny's trademark umbrella. Technical hitches had prevented Mary Poppins' flight into the auditorium during preview performances. A number of celebrities turned out for the musical's premiere, including actress Barbara Windsor, comic Graham Norton and Sir Richard Attenborough.

The show's director Richard Eyre issued a warning earlier in the week that the show was unsuitable for children under seven, while under-threes are barred. Mary Poppins was originally created by author Pamela Travers, who is said to have cried when she saw Disney's 1964 film starring Julie Andrews. Travers had intended the story to be a lot darker than the perennial family favourite. Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said he hopes the musical is a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book.

entertainment,"Levy tipped for Whitbread prize

Novelist Andrea Levy is favourite to win the main Whitbread Prize book of the year award, after winning novel of the year with her book Small Island.

The book has already won the Orange Prize for fiction, and is now 5/4 favourite for the £25,000 Whitbread. Second favourite is a biography of Mary Queen of Scots, by John Guy. A panel of judges including Sir Trevor McDonald, actor Hugh Grant and writer Joanne Harris will decide the overall winner on Tuesday.

The five writers in line for the award won their respective categories - first novel, novel, biography, poetry and children's book - on 6 January. Small Island, Levy's fourth novel, is set in post-war London and centres on a landlady and her lodgers. One is a Jamaican who joined British troops to fight Hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in the UK. ""What could have been a didactic or preachy prospect turns out to hilarious, moving humane and eye-popping. It's hard to think of anybody not enjoying it,"" wrote the judges. The judges called Guy's My Heart is My Own: The Life of Mary Queen of Scots ""an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens"". Guy has published many histories, including one of Tudor England. He is a fellow at Clare College, Cambridge and became a honorary research professor of the University of St Andrews in 2003.

The other contenders include Susan Fletcher for Eve Green, which won the first novel prize. Fletcher has recently graduated from the University of East Anglia's creative writing course. The fourth book in the running is Corpus, Michael Symmons Roberts' fourth collection of poems. As well as writing poetry, Symmons Roberts also makes documentary films. Geraldine McCaughrean is the final contender, having won the children's fiction category for the third time for Not the End of the World. McCaughrean, who went into magazine publishing after studying teaching, previously won the category in 1987 with A Little Lower than Angels and in 1994 with Gold Dust.

entertainment,"Da Vinci Code is 'lousy history'

The plot of an international bestseller that thousands of readers are likely to receive as a Christmas present is 'laughable', a clergyman has said.

The Da Vinci Code claims Jesus was not crucified, but married Mary Magdalene and died a normal death. It claims this was later covered up by the Church. The Bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev Dr Tom Wright, described the novel as a ""great thriller"" but ""lousy history"". The book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. Despite enjoying Dan Brown's conspiracy theory, the Bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims.

Writing his Christmas message in the Northern Echo, the Bishop said: ""Conspiracy theories are always fun - fun to invent, fun to read, fun to fantasise about. ""Dan Brown is the best writer I've come across in the genre, but anyone who knows anything about 1st century history will see that this underlying material is laughable."" A great deal of credible evidence proves the Biblical version of Jesus' life was true, according to the Bishop. ""The evidence for Jesus and the origins of Christianity is astonishingly good,"" he said. ""We have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the gospels and letters in the New Testament than we have for the main classical authors like Cicero, Virgil and Tacitus.

""Historical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of Jesus, with all sorts of incidental details that fit the time when he lived, and don't fit the world of later legend."" Brown's book has become a publishing phenomenon, consistently topping book charts in the UK and US. The Da Vinci Code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications, including guides on to how to read the book, rebuttals and counter claims. The book, which has become an international best-seller in little over two years, is set to be made into a film starring Tom Hanks.

entertainment,"Uganda bans Vagina Monologues

Uganda's authorities have banned the play The Vagina Monologues, due to open in the capital, Kampala this weekend.

The Ugandan Media Council said the performance would not be put on as it promoted and glorified acts such as lesbianism and homosexuality. It said the production could go ahead if the organisers ""expunge all the offending parts"". But the organisers of the play say it raises awareness of sexual abuse against women. ""The play promotes illegal, unnatural sexual acts, homosexuality and prostitution, it should be and is hereby banned,"" the council's ruling said.

The show, which has been a controversial sell-out around the world, explores female sexuality and strength through individual women telling their stories through monologues. Some parliamentarians and church leaders are also siding with the Media Council, Uganda's New Vision newspaper reports. ""The play is obscene and pornographic although it was under the guise of women's liberation,"" MP Kefa Ssempgani told parliament.

But the work's author, US playwright Eve Ensler, says it is all about women's empowerment. ""There is obviously some fear of the vagina and saying the word vagina,"" Ms Ensler told the BBC. ""It's not a slang word or dirty word it's a biological, anatomical word."" She said the play is being produced and performed by Ugandan women and it is not being forced on them. The four Ugandan NGOs organising the play intended to raise money to campaign to stop violence against women and to raise funds for the war-torn north of the country. ""I'm extremely outraged at the hypocrisy,"" the play's organiser in Uganda, Sarah Mukasa, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. ""I'm amazed that this country Uganda gives the impression that it is progressive and supports women's rights and the notions of free speech; yet when women want to share their stories the government uses the apparatus of state to shut us up.""

entertainment,"Neeson in bid to revive theatre

Hollywood film star Liam Neeson has held a dinner party in New York to promote Belfast's Lyric Theatre.

The Ballymena-born actor said that the theatre on Ridgeway Street was in a ""very dilapidated condition"". Lyric chairman David Johnston has said that rebuilding the theatre, at a cost of £8m is the only answer.

entertainment,"Arthur Hailey: King of the bestsellers

Novelist Arthur Hailey, who has died at the age of 84, was known for his bestselling page-turners exploring the inner workings of various industries, from the hotels to high finance.

Born in Luton, Bedfordshire, on 5 April 1920, Hailey was the only child of working class parents, They could not afford to keep him in school beyond the age of 14. He served as a pilot with the Royal Air Force during World War II, flying fighter planes to the Middle East. It was an occupation that was later to feature in his authorial debut, the television screenplay Flight into Danger. Hailey emigrated to Canada in 1947, where he eventually became a citizen. He wanted to be a writer from an early age, but did not take it up professionally until his mid-thirties, when he was inspired to write his first screenplay while on a return flight to Toronto.

""I fell to daydreaming. I visualised the pilots at the controls and wondered what would happen if they both got sick. Could I fly the airplane? I was a rusty wartime pilot who hadn't flown for nine years... "" Hailey later recalled. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation bought Flight into Danger for $600 (£318) and it was shown on TV in April 1956. It was later memorably spoofed in the 1980 comedy Airplane!, starring Leslie Nielsen. Hailey worked as a screenwriter for a couple of years, before turning to novels. He went on to produce 11 best-selling books, which were published into 38 languages in 40 countries. Flight into Danger was adapted to become Hailey's first novel, Runaway Zero-Eight in 1958. The Final Diagnosis and In High Places followed, both achieving a popular following. But it was not until Hotel, in 1965, that Hollywood came calling. The hit novel took four years to write, and stayed on national best-seller lists for a full year. It was turned into a movie in 1967 and later adapted into a glossy soap in the 1980s, starring James Brolin. Airport (1968) arguably remains Hailey's best-loved work and prompted the disaster movie genre. The thriller follows events in the sky, and on the ground at a snow-logged airport, when a terrorist boards an airplane with a bomb.

The book was adapted into a hit film in 1970, starring Burt Lancaster as the harassed aiport manager and Dean Martin as a womanising pilot, alongside Jean Seberg and Jacqueline Bisset. In a testament to the popularity of the fledgling disaster genre - three sequels followed. The writer was known for his painstaking research into the professions around which each novel was centred, drawing his characters ""from real life"" and taking up to three years to produce each book. ""I have never been able to write quickly or easily. I am too self-critical for that. I am never satisfied,"" he once said. In 1969, he moved to Nassau in the Bahamas, with his wife Sheila. Wheels (1971), The Moneychangers (1975) and Overload (1979) followed. Despite a lukewarm response from critics, and few literary accolades, Hailey was at the height of his fame in the seventies and continued to attract the attention of Hollywood producers. Strong Medicine, Hailey's blockbuster focusing on the pharmaceutical industry, was turned into a film in 1986, starring Sam Neill, Douglas Fairbanks Jr and a panoply of former soap stars. The 1997 novel Detective proved to be Hailey's final book, when at the age of 77 he decided to retire. Hailey's health began to deteriorate in recent years, twice undergoing heart surgery. He suffered a stroke just two months ago. He died in his sleep on Wednesday, after dinner with his wife and two of his six children at his home in New Providence island. ""He had a wonderful life. His greatest ambition was to see his name on a book and he certainly achieved that,"" said his wife, Sheila.

Novelist Arthur Hailey, renowned for his gripping bestsellers that delved into the inner workings of industries like hotels, aviation, and finance, died at age 84. His page-turners, characterized by meticulous research and real-life-inspired characters, captivated global audiences and inspired Hollywood adaptations, despite lukewarm critical reception.

Born on April 5, 1920, in Luton, Bedfordshire, England, Hailey was the only child of working-class parents who could not afford his education beyond age 14. During World War II, he served as a Royal Air Force pilot, flying fighter planes to the Middle East—an experience that later influenced his writing. In 1947, he emigrated to Canada, eventually becoming a citizen. Hailey harbored ambitions to write from an early age but pursued it professionally only in his mid-30s. His breakthrough came during a flight to Toronto, where he daydreamed about pilots falling ill mid-air, drawing on his own rusty piloting skills. This idea became the 1956 television screenplay *Flight into Danger*, sold to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for $600. It was later adapted into his debut novel, *Runway Zero-Eight* (1958), and memorably spoofed in the 1980 comedy film *Airplane!* starring Leslie Nielsen.

After initial screenwriting stints, Hailey transitioned to novels, producing 11 bestsellers translated into 38 languages across 40 countries. Early works like *The Final Diagnosis* and *In High Places* gained popularity, but *Hotel* (1965) marked his ascent to fame. Researched over four years, it topped bestseller lists for a year and was adapted into a 1967 film and a 1980s TV soap starring James Brolin. *Airport* (1968), arguably his most beloved, pioneered the disaster movie genre. The thriller, set amid a snowbound airport and a bomb threat, was filmed in 1970 with stars like Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin, Jean Seberg, and Jacqueline Bisset, spawning three sequels.

Hailey's method involved exhaustive research—up to three years per book—into professions, yielding authentic narratives. He admitted to being self-critical, never writing quickly. Subsequent hits included *Wheels* (1971) on the auto industry, *The Moneychangers* (1975) on banking, *Overload* (1979) on energy, and *Strong Medicine* (1984) on pharmaceuticals, adapted into a 1986 film with Sam Neill and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. His final novel, *Detective* (1997), came at age 77, after which he retired.

In 1969, Hailey moved to Nassau, Bahamas, with his wife Sheila. They had six children. His health declined in later years, with two heart surgeries and a stroke two months before his death. He passed away peacefully in his sleep on Wednesday at his New Providence home, after dinner with Sheila and two children. As Sheila reflected, ""He had a wonderful life. His greatest ambition was to see his name on a book and he certainly achieved that.""

Airport (1968), his best-known work, helped launch the disaster-movie genre; its 1970 film adaptation starred Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin, Jean Seberg and Jacqueline Bisset and led to three sequels. Known for meticulous research and characters drawn from real life, Hailey often spent up to three years per book, saying he was ""never satisfied."" After moving to Nassau, Bahamas, in 1969 with his wife, Sheila, he wrote Wheels (1971), The Moneychangers (1975) and Overload (1979).

His final novel, Detective, appeared in 1997, after which he retired. Hailey had undergone two heart surgeries and suffered a stroke two months ago. He died in his sleep on Wednesday at his New Providence Island home after dinner with his wife and two of their six children. ""He had a wonderful life,"" Sheila said.","Novelist Arthur Hailey, renowned for his bestselling and meticulously researched page-turners that explored the inner workings of major industries, has died at the age of 84. Born in Luton, England, on April 5, 1920, to working-class parents, Hailey’s formal education ended at age 14. He later served as a Royal Air Force pilot during World War II, an experience that would directly inspire his writing career.

After emigrating to Canada in 1947, Hailey did not begin writing professionally until his mid-thirties. The catalyst was a daydream on a flight where he imagined the pilots becoming incapacitated, leading him to write the television screenplay *Flight into Danger*. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation bought the script, and it aired in 1956 to great success. The story was later adapted into Hailey’s first novel, *Runaway Zero-Eight* (1958), and was memorably spoofed in the 1980 comedy film *Airplane!*.

Hailey’s breakthrough came with *Hotel* in 1965. The novel, which took four years to write, stayed on national bestseller lists for a full year and was adapted into a successful 1967 movie and later a popular television series. However, his most iconic work is arguably *Airport* (1968), a thriller about a snowbound airport manager dealing with a terrorist bomber on a flight. The book’s blockbuster 1970 film adaptation, starring Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin, is credited with launching the disaster movie genre and spawned three sequels.

Hailey was known for his painstaking research, often taking up to three years to produce a single book. Despite a lukewarm response from literary critics, his novels were immensely popular with the public and Hollywood, leading to a string of hits in the 1970s, including *Wheels*, *The Moneychangers*, and *Overload*. He published his final novel, *Detective*, in 1997 before retiring. After suffering from deteriorating health, including two heart surgeries and a recent stroke, Hailey died in his sleep at his home in the Bahamas.

After emigrating to Canada in 1947, Hailey transitioned from screenwriting to novels, achieving significant success with titles like ""Hotel"" and ""Airport.""

""Hotel,"" published in 1965, marked a turning point in his career, spending a year on national bestseller lists and spawning a successful film adaptation.  However, it was ""Airport"" (1968), a thriller set against the backdrop of a snow-laden airport, that solidified his fame and arguably launched the modern disaster movie genre. The book's success led to several film sequels and cemented Hailey's status as a master of the genre.  His writing process was characterized by painstaking research and a dedication to realism, often taking three years to complete each novel.  He meticulously crafted his characters, drawing inspiration from real-life individuals.

Throughout his career, Hailey published eleven bestselling novels translated into 38 languages and distributed across 40 countries. His works explored diverse sectors, including hotels, finance, and the pharmaceutical industry, as seen in ""The Moneychangers"" and ""Strong Medicine,"" the latter adapted into a 1986 film. Despite receiving limited critical acclaim, his commercial success was undeniable, attracting continuous attention from Hollywood producers.  He maintained his prolific output into his seventies, with ""Detective"" (1997) marking his final novel before retirement.  Hailey's death, following a recent stroke, came peacefully in his sleep, leaving behind a legacy of gripping narratives and a lasting impact on popular culture.  His wife, Sheila, described his life as ""wonderful,"" emphasizing the fulfillment of his greatest ambition: seeing his name on a published book.
","Novelist Arthur Hailey, who has died at the age of 84, was known for his bestselling page-turners exploring the inner workings of various industries, from the hotels to high finance. Born in Luton, Bedfordshire, on 5 April 1920, Hailey was the only child of working class parents, They could not afford to keep him in school beyond the age of 14. He served as a pilot with the Royal Air Force during World War II, flying fighter planes to the Middle East. It was an occupation that was later to feature in his authorial debut, the television screenplay Flight into Danger. Hailey emigrated to Canada in 1947, where he eventually became a citizen. He wanted to be a writer from an early age, but did not take it up professionally until his mid-thirties, when he was inspired to write his first screenplay while on a return flight to Toronto. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation bought Flight into Danger for $600 (£318) and it was shown on TV in April 1956. Hailey worked as a screenwriter for a couple of years, before turning to novels. He went on to produce 11 best-selling books, which were published into 38 languages in 40 countries. But it was not until Hotel, in 1965, that Hollywood came calling. The hit novel took four years to write, and stayed on national best-seller lists for a full year. It was turned into a movie in 1967 and later adapted into a glossy soap in the 1980s, starring James Brolin. Airport (1968) arguably remains Hailey's best-loved work and prompted the disaster movie genre. The writer was known for his painstaking research into the professions around which each novel was centred, drawing his characters ""from real life"" and taking up to three years to produce each book. Despite a lukewarm response from critics, and few literary accolades, Hailey was at the height of his fame in the seventies and continued to attract the attention of Hollywood producers. Strong Medicine, Hailey's blockbuster focusing on the pharmaceutical industry, was turned into a film in 1986, starring Sam Neill, Douglas Fairbanks Jr and a panoply of former soap stars. The 1997 novel Detective proved to be Hailey's final book, when at the age of 77 he decided to retire. He died in his sleep on Wednesday, after dinner with his wife and two of his six children at his home in New Providence island.","Arthur Hailey, a renowned novelist who passed away at 84, achieved widespread recognition for his captivating page-turners that delved into the intricate workings of diverse industries, ranging from the hospitality sector to the complex world of high finance.

politics,"Labour plans maternity pay rise

Maternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt.

It would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as ""desperate"", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.

Ms Hewitt said: ""We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. ""We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament."" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. ""We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400."" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: ""These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.""

She said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: ""While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected."" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.

Ms Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be ""crippled"" by the move. ""While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,"" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.

The UK's Trade and Industry Secretary, Patricia Hewitt, has announced Labour government proposals to increase maternity pay by £1,400 for new mothers. The core of the plan is to extend paid maternity leave from the current six months to nine months by 2007, with the ultimate ambition of extending it to a full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament. Hewitt stated that while mothers are entitled to 12 months of leave, many cannot afford the unpaid final six months. Other potential policies under consideration include allowing fathers to take a portion of their partner's maternity pay or leave, and expanding flexible working rights to parents with older children.

The announcement was met with criticism. The Conservatives labeled the plan a ""desperate"" recycling of a previous announcement aimed at winning back female voters. The Liberal Democrats argued the funds were ""misdirected,"" suggesting the money would be better spent boosting pay within the initial six-month period.

The proposal also suggests exploring options for fathers to utilize some of the maternity pay or leave, and extending flexible working rights to parents of older children.

The information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.

Richard Thomas ""totally condemned"" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served ""no current purpose"", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.

Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was ""too unlikely to have been a coincidence"", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or ""the destruction of important records"". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the ""e-mail regime"" could ""support the freedom of information regime"".

Mr Thomas said: ""The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence."" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.

""If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. ""But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned."" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.

He highlighted existing guidance advocating retention unless an email serves no current purpose.  The timing of the Cabinet Office's order is viewed with suspicion by both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, who have demanded explanations from the government.  Tory leader Michael Howard and Lib Dem Alan Beith have expressed concerns that the deletion of potentially millions of emails could severely hamper crucial inquiries like the Hutton Inquiry and undermine the new Act's transparency goals.  While the Cabinet Office denies the deletions were related to the new law or the destruction of important records, the Information Commissioner's investigation will determine whether deliberate destruction of evidence to circumvent the Freedom of Information Act occurred.  The Act, extending to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, grants public access to information held by numerous public bodies, and its implementation is under the Commissioner's scrutiny.  The investigation's findings will be critical in assessing the government's compliance with the new legislation.

politics,"Hewitt decries 'career sexism'

Plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.

Patricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an ""increasingly high priority"" and a ""shared goal across government"". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: ""Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. ""We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.""

Ms Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and ""taster courses"" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).

The minister told delegates that getting rid of ""career sexism"" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.

""Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. ""It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,"" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. ""Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. ""Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. ""But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.""

She added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. ""The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p."" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.

It has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of ""natural differences"" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.

Hewitt also launched measures to tackle “career sexism” and widen women’s access to male‑dominated fields. Plans include funding universities to help female science and engineering graduates into jobs and offering “taster courses” for men and women considering non‑traditional roles. She argued persistent occupational segregation and stereotypes hold women back, citing engineering—where only 10% are women—and construction, plus assumptions childcare is “for women,” stressing career sexism cuts both ways.

Closing the gender pay gap is central to the agenda. According to the EOC, women in full‑time work earn about 19% less than men—roughly 80p for every male pound—and part‑time women about 60p. Women hold under 10% of top posts in FTSE 100 firms, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, and retired women receive over half men’s income on average.

Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt has urged that extending paid maternity leave beyond the current six months be a key feature in Labour's election manifesto, describing it as an ""increasingly high priority"" and a shared government goal. Speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organized by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC), Hewitt noted that costs are under evaluation, as taxpayers reimburse employers for such leave. Currently, mothers receive up to six months paid and six months unpaid.

Hewitt also launched initiatives to combat ""career sexism,"" which she said hinders women's potential and perpetuates the gender pay gap. New measures include funding for universities to assist female science and engineering graduates in securing jobs, and ""taster courses"" for both genders in non-traditional roles. She emphasized that sexism affects opportunities across ages and assumes job suitability based on sex, leading to segregated employment: women dominate low-paid sectors, while fields like engineering (10% female) and construction remain male-heavy. Conversely, roles like childcare are stereotyped as female.

Full-time women earn 19% less than men, or 80p for every £1, with part-time figures at 60p. Hewitt highlighted EOC research showing many attribute the gap to ""natural differences"" between sexes. Women hold under 10% of top roles in FTSE 100 companies, police, judiciary, and unions, and retired women average half the income of male counterparts. The Department for Trade and Industry will fund a TUC-led pay experts panel to advise companies on equal wage policies, aiming to dismantle barriers and boost productivity.

Hewitt also launched a new drive to eliminate ""career sexism,"" which she identified as a vital step toward closing the gender pay gap. She defined this as the perpetuation of outdated stereotypes that segregate employment, funneling women into low-paid, female-dominated jobs while industries like engineering and construction remain overwhelmingly male. Citing EOC figures, she noted that full-time working women earn 19% less than men—receiving about 80p for every pound a man earns.

To combat this, the government will fund universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and support ""taster courses"" for both men and women in non-traditional fields.

Hewitt highlighted the significant gender pay gap, with women earning 80p for every pound earned by men in full-time roles and 60p for part-time work.  The initiative also includes funding a new TUC-run panel of pay experts to advise companies on equal wage policies.  The effort addresses deeply rooted societal beliefs about gender roles and seeks to actively challenge the persistent underrepresentation of women in leadership positions across various sectors.

The Labour Party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester and not Blackpool, it has been confirmed.

The much trailed decision was ratified by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.

For years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.

Colin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: ""We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. ""Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. ""It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country."" The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.

Chancellor Gordon Brown's closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a Budget giveaway on 16 March.

Ed Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.

Mr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - ""with a margin to spare"". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.

He also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. ""If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,"" he told a Parliamentary lunch. ""This is a big change in our political culture.""

During an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. ""I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,"" he said.

His assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: ""Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering."" Sir Digby added: ""I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. ""We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. ""That would be a good way to spend any excess.""

Mr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. ""I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,"" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.

Balls, a former chief economic adviser to the Treasury and now a prospective Labour MP, said he is confident Brown will meet his fiscal “golden rule” with room to spare and that the Budget will prioritise economic stability. He suggested the government would seek to build on existing tax credit policies rather than launch new largesse.

Addressing speculation about interest rates, Balls said any Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee move to raise rates ahead of an expected May election—amid continued house price growth and near‑record consumer borrowing—would reflect the economy’s strength and would not be a decisive electoral issue for Labour.

His remarks followed a warning from CBI director general Sir Digby Jones, who urged Brown to resist using any surplus for “pre‑election bribes.” Jones praised Brown’s record for prudence and argued that business values “boring stability” above all, recommending any additional funds be channelled into upgrading workforce skills to boost UK competitiveness rather than increasing public spending.

In media appearances, including BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Balls reiterated that the Budget would not jeopardise stability and noted there was no comparable giveaway before the 2001 election. He declined to speculate on Brown’s post‑election role amid rumours the chancellor could be moved to the Foreign Office, saying only that Brown intends to serve in a third‑term Labour government focused on voters’ priorities.

Jones stressed the importance of economic stability, advising that any extra cash should be directed toward improving workforce skills to boost Britain's competitiveness. ""Stability is the key word—British business needs boring stability more than anything,"" Jones said. He praised Brown's prudent track record but cautioned against increasing public spending or giveaways, recommending investments in education and training instead.

Addressing potential interest rate hikes by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), Balls downplayed their impact on Labour's electoral prospects. Recent data showing rising house prices and near-record consumer borrowing in January have fueled expectations of a rate increase before the election. However, Balls argued that such a move, if driven by economic strength, would not become a major issue for voters, marking a shift in Britain's political culture. He referenced the absence of spending sprees before the 2001 election as precedent.

Balls declined to speculate on Brown's future role post-election, amid rumors he might become Foreign Secretary. Instead, he affirmed Brown's commitment to a successful third Labour term, focused on public priorities and countering Conservative threats.

He also addressed the growing expectation of an interest rate increase by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), driven by rising house prices and record consumer borrowing. Mr. Balls argued that should the MPC deem a rate hike necessary due to economic strength, it would not negatively impact the Labour Party's election chances. He described this potential public acceptance as a ""big change in our political culture,"" suggesting voters would see it as a sign of a well-managed economy rather than a political liability for the incumbent government.

politics,"'Errors' doomed first Dome sale

The initial attempt to sell the Millennium Dome failed due to a catalogue of errors, a report by the government's finance watchdog says.

The report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the Millennium exhibition ended. The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers £28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. Finally, a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. More than £550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in Greenwich, London.

The NAO report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the Dome. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said a good deal had been secured. ""Delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the Millennium Village and elsewhere on the peninsula,"" he said. But Edward Leigh, who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the Dome deal. He said: ""This report also shows that the first attempt to sell the Dome proved a complete fiasco. Every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. The process was confused and muddled."" He added: ""Four years after the Millennium Exhibition closed, the Government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that, incredible as it may seem, should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. However, it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt."" NAO head Sir John Bourn said: ""In difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition, English Partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.""

politics,"Fox attacks Blair's Tory 'lies'

Tony Blair lied when he took the UK to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign, say the Tories.

Tory co-chairman Liam Fox was speaking after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a ""hard right agenda"". Dr Fox told BBC Radio: ""If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."" He would not discuss reports the party repaid £500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.

The prime minister ratcheted up Labour's pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party's spring conference. He insisted he did not know the poll date, but it is widely expected to be 5 May.

In what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair said: ""I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street."" He described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric, then struggling to live up to the expectations, and reaching the point of raised voices and ""throwing crockery"". He warned his supporters against complacency, saying: ""It's a fight for the future of our country, it's a fight that for Britain and the people of Britain we have to win.""

In a heated pre-election exchange, Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox accused Prime Minister Tony Blair of lying during the campaign, drawing parallels to alleged deceptions over the Iraq war. Fox claimed Blair has ""no qualms about lying"" and criticized Labour's tactics as ""fear and smear,"" involving fabrications about Tory policies followed by attacks on those falsehoods. He dismissed Labour's six new pledges as ""vacuous"" and suggested Blair fears voter backlash for unfulfilled promises. Fox declined to address reports that the Tories repaid £500,000 to donor Lord Ashcroft after his pessimistic election forecast, stating the party repays loans as due without commenting on specifics, while affirming a positive relationship with Ashcroft.

Blair intensified Labour's campaigning with a weekend helicopter tour and a passionate speech at the party's spring conference in Gateshead. He reaffirmed his ""hunger"" for leadership, likening his public relationship to a marriage with initial euphoria, subsequent struggles, and heated arguments. Warning against complacency, Blair framed the election as a ""fight for Britain's future"" that Labour must win. He attacked the Conservatives' ""hard right agenda"" and warned that voting for Tory leader Michael Howard or Liberal Democrat Charles Kennedy would effectively yield a Tory government, halting national progress. Blair denied knowing the election date, though May 5 is widely anticipated.

Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy prepared to counter Blair's ""touchy-feely"" rhetoric, accusing it of failing to restore public trust. Kennedy launched a nationwide tour visiting cities like Manchester, Liverpool, and Leicester, plus rural areas in Somerset, Dorset, and the South West. He emphasized three-party politics, positioning Lib Dems as key challengers to Labour in northern urban seats and to Conservatives in southern and rural ones, while noting Tories' weakness in Scotland and Wales. The exchanges highlight escalating tensions as parties gear up for the expected poll.

politics,"Women MPs reveal sexist taunts

Women MPs endure ""shocking"" levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows.

Male MPs pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered ""melons"" as women made Commons speeches, researchers from Birkbeck College were told. Labour's Yvette Cooper said she found it hard to persuade Commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary. Some 83 MPs gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study ""Whose Secretary are You, minister"".

The research team, under Professor Joni Lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at Westminster. But what emerged was complaints from MPs of all parties of sexist barracking in the Chamber, sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities. Barbara Follet, one of the so-called ""Blair Babes"" elected in 1997, told researchers: ""I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say 'melons' as we spoke."" Former Liberal Democrat MP Jackie Ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading MP on topics such as women's legs or their sexual persuasion. And ex-Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women ""Betty"".

""When I said, 'Look you know my name isn't Betty', he said, 'ah but you're all the same, so I call you all Betty'."" Harriet Harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the Cabinet: ""Well, you've only succeeded because you're a woman."" Another current member of the Cabinet says she was told: ""Oh, you've had a very fast rise, who have you been sleeping with?"" Even after the great influx of women MPs at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the Cabinet, female MPs often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world.

Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather, the most recent female MP to be elected, told researchers: ""Lots of people say it's like an old boys club. ""I've always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school - you know a public school full of teenagers."" Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings. ""We expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent. We expected to find a couple of shocking episodes."" But she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards. This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to ""put up with"" the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said. But she added: ""Some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and I am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back. ""What I think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the House of Commons."" The interviews are to be placed in the British Library as a historical record.

Reported incidents include male MPs miming breast-juggling and shouting “melons” during women’s speeches; Yvette Cooper struggling to convince officials she was a minister rather than a secretary; Jackie Ballard receiving repeated remarks about women’s legs or sexual orientation from a senior colleague; Gillian Shepherd being told all women would be called “Betty”; Harriet Harman being told she advanced only because she is a woman; and a current Cabinet member being asked whom she had “been sleeping with” to rise quickly.

Professor Joni Lovenduski, who led the research with MP Margaret Moran and a team of journalists, said the prevalence and crudeness of the behavior exceeded expectations. While the 1997 influx of women MPs and more women in Cabinet changed the climate—creating a cohort less willing to tolerate sexism—many respondents still feel marginalised within a male-dominated culture that resembles an “old boys’ club,” or, as Sarah Teather put it, “a teenage public school.” Lovenduski warns that gains are fragile: if the number of women falls, the culture could regress. The interviews will be archived at the British Library to preserve this record and inform future reform. Researchers say public will be shocked such conduct persists in Parliament.","### Abstract: Sexist Taunts Faced by Women MPs in UK Parliament

A groundbreaking study by Birkbeck College, led by Professor Joni Lovenduski, exposes ""shocking"" levels of sexist abuse endured by women MPs from their male colleagues in the House of Commons. Based on 100 hours of taped interviews with 83 MPs across parties, the research titled ""Whose Secretary are You, Minister?"" initially aimed to explore women's achievements and experiences at Westminster but uncovered widespread complaints of sexist barracking, insults, and patronizing assumptions about their abilities.

Prominent examples include male MPs pretending to juggle imaginary breasts and jeering ""melons"" during women's speeches, as recounted by Labour MP Barbara Follett, one of the 1997 ""Blair Babes."" Former Liberal Democrat MP Jackie Ballard described a leading MP's relentless comments on women's legs or sexual orientation.

Labour's Yvette Cooper struggled to convince officials she was a minister, not a secretary. Harriet Harman faced hostility upon her Cabinet promotion, with remarks like, ""You've only succeeded because you're a woman."" Another current Cabinet member was accused of advancing by ""sleeping with"" superiors.

Despite the 1997 influx of women MPs increasing female representation and Cabinet roles, many describe Parliament as an ""old boys' club"" or ""teenage public school,"" per Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather. Prof Lovenduski expressed shock at the extent of such behavior, noting it was more pervasive than anticipated. She highlighted improvements post-1997, attributing them to greater numbers of women unwilling to tolerate sexism, but warned that a decline in female MPs could revert conditions. The study underscores persistent gender biases in a male-dominated environment, even as more women refuse to ""put up with"" it. The interviews will be archived in the British Library as a historical record, serving as a stark reminder of ongoing challenges for gender equality in politics.

Labour’s Yvette Cooper recounted struggles to convince Commons staff she was a minister rather than a secretary. Barbara Follett described male Conservatives miming breast-juggling and shouting “melons” when Labour women spoke. Former Liberal Democrat Jackie Ballard recalled repeated comments from a senior MP about women’s bodies and sexual orientation. Ex-Conservative education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered a colleague who called all women “Betty,” insisting, “you’re all the same.” Cabinet ministers reported overtly sexist put-downs, including claims that success owed to gender or insinuations about sleeping one’s way up. Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather characterized the culture as less an “old boys’ club” and more like a “teenage public school.”

Lead researcher Professor Joni Lovenduski said the scope of the misogyny was “shocking,” exceeding expectations of a few isolated incidents. She noted improvement since the large 1997 intake of women MPs—the “Blair Babes”—because more women were present and unwilling to tolerate sexist behavior. However, she warned that gains could be reversed if female representation fell, suggesting the hostile environment could reassert itself. Despite increased numbers of women in the Cabinet, many still feel peripheral in a male-dominated institution. The interviews will be archived in the British Library as a historical record, underscoring public concern that such conduct persists within the House of Commons.","A new study from Birkbeck College, titled ""Whose Secretary are You, minister,"" reveals that women Members of Parliament endure ""shocking"" levels of sexist abuse and patronizing behavior from their male counterparts at Westminster.

The findings paint a picture of a pervasive, hostile, and male-dominated culture within the House of Commons.

The report details numerous specific instances of demeaning conduct. Barbara Follet, one of the ""Blair Babes"" elected in 1997, recounted how male Conservative MPs would pretend to juggle imaginary breasts and jeer ""melons"" as women delivered speeches. Former Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered a colleague who called all women ""Betty,"" explaining, ""you're all the same.""

Yvette Cooper also noted her difficulty in persuading Commons officials that she was a minister and not a secretary.

The study suggests that the atmosphere in Parliament feels like a ""teenage public school,"" alienating its female members. Professor Lovenduski admitted her team was shocked by the extent of the sexism uncovered. She did note a positive change following the 1997 general election, as the large influx of new women MPs was less willing to ""put up with"" such attitudes. However, she warned that this progress remains fragile and could easily be reversed if female representation in Parliament were to decline again.

Incidents included male MPs mimicking breast-juggling and shouting ""melons"" during women's speeches,  making demeaning remarks about women's appearances and sexuality, and questioning female MPs' achievements by attributing their success to factors other than merit.  Even high-ranking female ministers faced such treatment, with some reporting being asked about their sexual relationships to explain their career advancement, or being addressed as ""Betty"" regardless of their actual name. While the study noted some improvement following the influx of women MPs in 1997, with increased collective resistance to such behavior, the researchers expressed concern that a decrease in female representation could lead to a resurgence of the sexist culture.  The persistence of this behavior in the House of Commons, a supposedly prestigious institution, shocked the researchers and highlights the need for significant cultural change. The interview transcripts will be archived in the British Library as a historical record of these experiences.

Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings. This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to ""put up with"" the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said. ""What I think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the House of Commons.""","A new study, ""Whose Secretary are You, minister?"", reveals shocking levels of sexist abuse endured by women Members of Parliament (MPs) from their male colleagues.  The research, conducted by Birkbeck College, involved 100 hours of taped interviews with 83 MPs across all parties.  Reported incidents include male MPs mimicking the act of juggling breasts and shouting ""melons"" during women's speeches.  Yvette Cooper (Labour) described the difficulty in being recognized as a minister rather than a secretary.  Numerous MPs recounted experiences of sexist barracking in the Commons chamber,  insulting remarks, and patronizing assumptions about their competence.  Barbara Follett described Conservative MPs mimicking breast movements and using the term ""melons"" during Labour women's speeches. Jackie Ballard (former Liberal Democrat MP) recalled a stream of comments targeting women's physical attributes and sexuality from a senior MP. Gillian Shepherd (former Tory education secretary) recounted being called ""Betty"" by a male colleague, despite correcting him.  Harriet Harman highlighted the hostility she faced upon entering the Cabinet, with some suggesting her success was due to her gender. Another current Cabinet member reported being asked about her sexual relationships to explain her rapid career advancement.  Even with the increased number of women MPs since 1997, many feel marginalized within a male-dominated environment, with one describing it as resembling a ""teenage public school.""  Professor Joni Lovenduski, lead researcher, expressed shock at the extent of the sexism, noting a difference between the experiences of women MPs before and after the 1997 election, attributing the improvement to the increased presence of women unwilling to tolerate such behavior.  However, she cautions that reversing the increase in female representation could lead to a return to the previous level of sexism. The study's findings, considered a historical record, are being archived at the British Library.

politics,"Campbell: E-mail row 'silly fuss'

Ex-No 10 media chief Alastair Campbell is at the centre of a new political row over an e-mail containing a four-letter outburst aimed at BBC journalists.

Mr Campbell sent the missive by mistake to BBC2's Newsnight after it sought to question his role in Labour's controversial poster campaign. He later contacted the show saying the original e-mail had been sent in error and that it was all a ""silly fuss"". Mr Campbell has recently re-joined Labour's election campaign.

The e-mail was revealed the day after Peter Mandelson, former Labour minister and now a European Commissioner, warned the BBC to steer away from ""demonising"" Mr Campbell. Mr Campbell messaged Newsnight after the programme investigated claims that Labour's advertising agency TBWA was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. The images, including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin, prompted accusations of anti-Semitism, claims denied by Labour.

Mr Campbell's e-mail, which was apparently intended for a party official, suggested they should get Trevor Beattie, TBWA's boss, to issue a statement. In it, he said: ""Just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together well and nobody here has spoken to standard. Posters done by by tbwa according to political brief. Now fuck off and cover something important you twats!"" The e-mail was sent by mistake to Newsnight journalist Andrew McFadyen. Realising his error, Mr Campbell then e-mailed Mr McFadyen pointing out the mistake, but suggesting presenter Jeremy Paxman would have seen the funny side.

He said: ""Not very good at this e-mail Blackberry malarkey. Just looked at log of sent messages, have realised e-mail meant for colleagues at TBWA has gone to you. For the record, first three sentences of email spot on. No row between me and trevor. ""Posters done by them according to our brief. I dreamt up flying pigs. Pigs not great but okay in the circs of Tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. TBWA made production. ""Campbell swears shock. Final sentence of earlier e-mail probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met but I'm sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter Mr P. ""Never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go. Must look forward not back.""

Later the prime minister's spokesman was asked by journalists about his view on Mr Campbell's use of abusive language. The spokesman said: ""The person you are referring to is capable of speaking for himself and he no longer works in government."" Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he had always had ""very good and polite relations"" with Mr Campbell, who he described as ""very talented"". But on the former spin doctor's use of language, Mr Straw said: ""I do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances. Maybe I mix with the wrong kind of journalists."" Liam Fox, Tory co-chairman, said the return of Mr Campbell was a sign of new ""sinister and underhand tactics"" by Labour.

Realizing the error, Campbell sent a follow‑up acknowledging the mix‑up—blaming “this e‑mail Blackberry malarkey”—and calling the storm a “silly fuss.” He insisted there was no rift with Beattie, said TBWA handled production according to Labour’s brief, and claimed credit for the “flying pigs” concept, which he defended as a response to Tory tax‑and‑spend promises. He quipped presenter Jeremy Paxman would see the funny side, while conceding his language was “a bit colourful.”

Downing Street distanced itself, with the prime minister’s spokesman noting Campbell no longer works in government.

politics,"Mrs Howard gets key election role

Michael Howard's ex-model wife, Sandra, is to play a leading role in the Conservative election campaign.

Mrs Howard will make solo visits to target seats as well as accompanying her husband on his helicopter campaign trail criss-crossing the country. Mr Howard will host a news conference at the party's London HQ every morning, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said. ""We want Michael to be as accessible as possible,"" Mr Fox said, adding that the party was not afraid of scrutiny.

The Tory leader wanted to meet as many ordinary members of the public, Mr Fox said. Tony Blair has also said he is intending to get out and talk to as many people as possible during the election campaign. But Labour campaign chiefs say there are no plans for Mr Blair to hold a daily news conference.

Mr Fox responded by accusing the prime minister of ""hiding away from the scrutiny of London's media"". The Liberal Democrats also say they are planning to hold daily news conferences with Charles Kennedy. On Mrs Howard's role, Mr Fox said: ""Sandra has already been campaigning with Michael on a number of visits and has been undertaking short visits herself. ""That pattern will continue. It's worked very well up until now."" Mrs Howard made her debut speech at the Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth last October. She used her speech on the fringe to highlight the work of a drugs charity, Addaction, which she supports. Mrs Howard has also appeared along side her husband on TV chat shows. During an interview on ITV1's This Morning she said she often criticised her husband for not showing the side of him that she knows.

politics,"PM apology over jailings

Tony Blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice.

The prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for IRA bomb attacks on pubs in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974. Mr Blair said: ""I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice."" He made the apology to members of the Conlon and Maguire families in his private room at Westminster. In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved ""to be completely and publicly exonerated"".

The families had hoped the apology would be made during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. However, one of the so-called Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. He said Mr Blair had spoken with ""such sincerity"", adding: ""He went beyond what we thought he would, he took time to listen to everyone. ""You could see he was moved by what people were saying. ""Tony Blair has healed rifts, he is helping to heal wounds. It's a day I never thought would come."" The move followed a huge campaign in Ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the IRA bombs which killed seven people. Mr Blair's official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would ""ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister's statement brought to them"".

Most of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. All were arrested because of a family connection to Gerry Conlon. Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe was arrested when travelling to London from Belfast to help his son. He died while serving his sentence. Also arrested were Anne Maguire and members of her family. Mrs Maguire was the relative with whom Giuseppe planned to stay in London, as well as two family friends. She said it was a ""wonderful feeling"" to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.

""The people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent,"" she said. They were all jailed for handling explosives, based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. In October 1989 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences of the Guildford Four, and in June 1991 it overturned the sentences on the Maguire Seven. Mr Conlon's case was highlighted in the Oscar-nominated film In The Name Of The Father, starring Daniel Day-Lewis.

politics,"Howard rebuts asylum criticisms

Tory leader Michael Howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.

Mr Howard, whose parents fled the Nazi threat to come to the UK, says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. His comments come in a BBC documentary called 'No More Mr Nasty'. TV presenter Anne Robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would ""like to kick your cat"". Ms Robinson, a friend of the Tory leader, also revealed that as a Cambridge student Mr Howard was ""much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover"" - although she denied having personal experience. ""I wasn't at Cambridge - and it's not personal experience - but I know people who were.""

Documentary maker Michael Cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to Mr Howard for his film portrait. The Tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s, his parents might not have been allowed into the country.

He replies: ""What is the inference of that? ""That if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you're not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants? ""That seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition? It would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.""

Ms Robinson, who presents The Weakest Link tells Cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in John Major's government. ""I used to have to sit on my hands because he'd get on television and give a passable impression of someone who'd like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. I mean it was very, very Draconian."" The film shows Mr Howard laughing at Rory Bremner's impression of him as Dracula, which he calls ""good fun"", apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the UK. The film shows the private side of the Tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife, ex-model Sandra. Asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses: ""Yeah, it would be more enjoyable if I could win occasionally too, but otherwise it's quite fun.""

Former Downing Street communications chief Alastair Campbell, now working on Labour's election campaign, says a ""touchy-feely"" image does not fit Mr Howard. He says Tony Blair was not worried by his opponents' early performance in their Commons clashes because Mr Howard lacked a ""big strategy"", including on issues like Iraq. The Tory leader brands such criticisms as ""absolutely rubbish"", arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of Mr Blair's failure to tell the truth on intelligence. Former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke says Mr Howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the Tory party than his personal image. Mr Clarke says the party is improving and it is ""conceivable"" it could win the next election. But he adds: ""It has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.""

In a BBC documentary titled *No More Mr Nasty*, Conservative leader Michael Howard robustly defends his proposal for asylum quotas against critics who question his stance as the son of Romanian-Jewish immigrants who fled Nazi persecution to the UK in the 1930s. Howard argues that such criticisms imply no one from an immigrant background could advocate immigration controls or become prime minister, calling the notion ""absolutely extraordinary."" He emphasizes that controlling immigration serves the country's interests, regardless of personal heritage.

The film, directed by Michael Cockerell with exclusive behind-the-scenes access, portrays Howard's efforts to soften his public image. TV presenter Anne Robinson, a friend, recalls his time as Home Secretary under John Major, describing him as projecting a ""Draconian"" demeanor that made him seem like someone who would ""kick your cat"" or ""put your baby in prison if he cried."" She also shares anecdotes from his Cambridge University days, noting he was ""much loved by women"" and a ""courteous, kind, and rather dashing lover,"" though she clarifies this is based on others' accounts, not her own.

Private moments captured include Howard watching TV at home and playing table tennis with his wife, former model Sandra, who jokingly admits she'd enjoy it more if she won occasionally. He laughs at comedian Rory Bremner's Dracula impression of him but denounces a ""serious falsehood"" implying he wants fewer black people in the UK.

Critics weigh in: Former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell dismisses Howard's ""touchy-feely"" rebrand, claiming he lacks a ""big strategy"" on issues like Iraq, where Howard insists he has been consistent in supporting the war while criticizing Tony Blair's handling of intelligence. Ex-Tory chancellor Ken Clarke acknowledges Howard's personal image challenges but stresses the greater need to broaden the party's appeal, deeming an election win ""conceivable"" if changes occur.

The documentary airs on BBC2 on Saturday, 12 February, at 2005 GMT, offering a multifaceted portrait of Howard amid election preparations.

Given behind-the-scenes access by filmmaker Michael Cockerell, Howard argues it is ""extraordinary"" to suggest descendants of immigrants cannot argue for stricter controls or aspire to be prime minister, adding that national interest should guide policy. The film revisits Howard’s hardline image as home secretary, with friend and TV presenter Anne Robinson saying he sometimes looked like a man who would ""kick your cat,"" while also recounting his popular, chivalrous reputation at Cambridge; she denies personal involvement. Howard is shown laughing at Rory Bremner’s Dracula impersonation, calling it ""good fun"" except for the insinuation he wants fewer black people in Britain, which he labels a serious falsehood. Domestic scenes of Howard watching television and playing table tennis with his wife, former model Sandra, aim to humanise him; she jokes it would be more fun if she won occasionally.

Labour strategist Alastair Campbell argues a ""touchy-feely"" makeover does not fit Howard and says Tony Blair was unruffled in early Commons exchanges because Howard lacked a ""big strategy,"" notably on Iraq. Howard calls that ""absolute rubbish,"" insisting he consistently backed the war while criticising Blair for not telling the truth about intelligence. Former chancellor Ken Clarke says Howard’s bigger challenge is changing public perceptions of the Conservative Party itself; while improvement makes a Tory win ""conceivable,"" he says the party must broaden its appeal.

The programme airs on BBC2 on Saturday 12 February at 2005 GMT. More candid moments promised.","In a BBC documentary titled 'No More Mr Nasty', Conservative leader Michael Howard has gone on the offensive to defend his proposal for asylum quotas against criticisms questioning how the son of immigrants could advocate for such a policy. Howard, whose parents fled the Nazi threat to come to the UK, dismisses the inference that his heritage should prevent him from putting forward views on immigration control. He argues such a proposition is ""absolutely extraordinary"" and would effectively mean no one from an immigrant family could ever become Prime Minister.

The documentary, granted behind-the-scenes access, delves into his public image and private life. TV presenter Anne Robinson, a friend, comments on his ""Draconian"" reputation as Home Secretary, recalling that he gave the impression he ""would like to kick your cat."" In contrast, she also reveals that as a Cambridge student, he was known as a ""courteous and kind and rather dashing lover,"" though she clarifies this is not from personal experience. The film aims to show a softer side, featuring Howard at home with his wife, Sandra, and his amused reaction to a satirical impression of him as Dracula, which he calls ""good fun"" apart from a serious falsehood suggesting he wants fewer black people in the UK.

The piece also incorporates political commentary. Labour's Alastair Campbell asserts that a ""touchy-feely"" image does not fit Howard and that he lacks a ""big strategy,"" a claim Howard brands ""absolutely rubbish."" Conversely, former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke believes the larger issue is not Howard’s personal image but the Conservative party’s need to ""broaden its appeal,"" adding that it is ""conceivable"" the party could win the next election.","In a new BBC documentary, ""No More Mr Nasty,"" Tory leader Michael Howard addresses criticisms regarding his stance on asylum quotas, particularly in light of his parents' immigration history.  He argues that the implication that someone of immigrant descent cannot advocate for immigration control is illogical and would effectively bar anyone with immigrant parents from holding high office, including the premiership.  The documentary offers a glimpse into Howard's personal life, showcasing his home life and contrasting his public image with anecdotes from friends like Anne Robinson, who describes his past persona as Home Secretary as overly harsh.  Robinson, while acknowledging Howard's earlier ""Draconian"" public image, also reveals a more personable side from his Cambridge days.  The film includes his reaction to comedic portrayals of himself, as well as commentary from political figures like Alastair Campbell and Ken Clarke.  Campbell suggests Howard lacks a comprehensive political strategy, a criticism Howard vehemently rejects, while Clarke focuses on the need for the Conservative party to broaden its appeal to improve its electoral prospects.  The documentary aims to present a more nuanced portrait of Howard, exploring both his public policies and personal life.  The film counters the perception of Howard as solely a hard-line politician, revealing aspects of his personality and family life. The documentary uses interviews and personal footage to create a balanced view.  The inclusion of diverse perspectives from political allies, opponents, and friends paints a complex picture of the Tory leader and his political trajectory.
","Tory leader Michael Howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas. Mr Howard, whose parents fled the Nazi threat to come to the UK, says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. His comments come in a BBC documentary called 'No More Mr Nasty'. The Tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s, his parents might not have been allowed into the country. He replies: ""What is the inference of that? ""That if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you're not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants? ""That seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition? It would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister."" Ms Robinson, who presents The Weakest Link tells Cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in John Major's government. ""I used to have to sit on my hands because he'd get on television and give a passable impression of someone who'd like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. I mean it was very, very Draconian."" Former Downing Street communications chief Alastair Campbell, now working on Labour's election campaign, says a ""touchy-feely"" image does not fit Mr Howard.","This BBC documentary, ""No More Mr Nasty,"" presents a nuanced portrait of Conservative Party leader Michael Howard, challenging perceptions of him as a harsh politician.  The film features interviews with Howard, along with commentary from various figures, including Anne Robinson and Alastair Campbell.  The documentary directly confronts criticism leveled against Howard's stance on asylum quotas, particularly the assertion that his immigrant background renders his policy proposals hypocritical. Howard counters this argument, asserting that such logic would preclude any individual with immigrant heritage from holding high political office.  The program also delves into Howard's past, showcasing anecdotes from his time as Home Secretary and exploring his personal life, contrasting his public image with more intimate moments, such as playing table tennis with his wife.  Anne Robinson, a friend of Howard's, shares personal observations of him, highlighting a contrast between his public persona and her own experience of him.  Furthermore, the documentary incorporates analysis from political strategists like Alastair Campbell, who assesses Howard's political strategies, and Ken Clarke, who offers insight into the challenges facing the Conservative Party in terms of image and broader public appeal.  The film ultimately aims to offer a balanced perspective on Michael Howard, moving beyond his established political image to reveal both his public and private facets and the criticisms that have shaped his political career.  The documentary's conclusion remains open-ended, allowing viewers to form their own interpretations of Howard's character and leadership style.

politics,"Blair rejects Tory terror offer

Tony Blair has rejected a Conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of anti-terror legislation.

The Tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the Anti-Terrorism Bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in November. Mr Blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already. The Tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed. The Lib Dems also oppose the plans.

The government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases.

Mr Blair's refusal to accept the Tories' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords. Peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on Thursday. The bill proposes ""control orders"", which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. These would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights.

The Tories want judicial oversight of all control orders, not just house arrest. Shadow Home Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio Four's the World at One his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. He said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a ""recruiting sergeant"" for terrorists. He went on to say: ""If we don't get the amendments we regard as essential, including the sunset clause, we will vote against the bill."" In the Commons, Mr Howard said it would be ""far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through"". Mr Blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.

The second, less stringent, type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by ""an eminent and independent person"". ""I believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk,"" said Mr Blair. The Lib Dems plan to oppose the Bill in the Lords on Thursday. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: ""There's a lot of talking left. I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months."" A spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch said it was a ""basic principle"" that people should only be punished after a fair trial. She added: ""Having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either.""

The Conservatives proposed a clause forcing Parliament to revisit the law in November; Blair said time‑limiting safeguards exist, noting house-arrest powers would be annually renewable, while other “control orders” would be appealable within 14 days and subject to quarterly independent review. The government has conceded a larger judicial role in house‑arrest cases, but Blair’s refusal on the sunset clause sets up united opposition from Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and crossbenchers in the House of Lords, which begins three days of scrutiny on Thursday.

The bill replaces powers to detain foreign suspects without trial—struck down by the law lords as breaching human rights—with a tiered system of control orders, ranging from curfews, tagging and communication bans to full house arrest. The Conservatives demand judicial oversight for all orders, not just the most severe. Shadow home secretary David Davis warned of miscarriages of justice that could become a “recruiting sergeant” for extremists, and pledged to vote against the bill without key amendments, including the sunset clause. Lib Dems oppose it, and Human Rights Watch criticised punishment without trial.","Tony Blair has rejected a Conservative compromise proposal on the Anti-Terrorism Bill, which aims to introduce ""control orders"" for terrorism suspects, including house arrest, curfews, electronic tagging, and restrictions on phone and internet use.

The Tories, led by Shadow Home Secretary David Davis and leader Michael Howard, demanded a sunset clause to force parliamentary review of the entire bill by November, along with full judicial oversight for all control orders to prevent miscarriages of justice. Davis warned that wrongful orders could serve as a ""recruiting sergeant"" for terrorists. Without these amendments, the Conservatives pledged to vote against the bill.

Blair argued that the legislation already includes safeguards, such as annual renewal for house arrest powers, court appeals within 14 days for less stringent orders, and quarterly reports by an independent reviewer. He emphasized balancing civil liberties with national security, stating he would not risk the latter.

The government has conceded on involving judges in house arrest decisions but faces unified opposition in the House of Lords, where peers begin detailed debates on Thursday. The Liberal Democrats, represented by Mark Oaten, also oppose the bill, deeming it flawed even with a temporary clause. Human Rights Watch criticized the measures, insisting punishments should follow fair trials, and judicial imposition without trial does not legitimize them.

politics,"Crisis 'ahead in social sciences'

A national body designed to tackle skills shortages in key subjects should be set up, a committee of MPs has said.

There was an ""absolute crisis"" in the recruitment of statisticians and other social science experts, the Commons science and technology committee added. ""Major problems"" are expected over the next 10 years as the social science workforce continues to age, it said. The committee was reporting on the work, strategy and spending plans of the Economic Social Research Council.

The council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country. It also liaises with the government and industry over their social science needs. In its report on the council's work the committee said: ""We are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting, in particular, the qualitative branches of social sciences. This mirrored previous concerns the committee had expressed on shortages in the fields of maths and chemistry, it said. ""It is hard to see how significant progress towards rectifying these shortages can be made through the deployment of Economic and Social Research Council's limited resources.

sport,"Claxton hunting first major medal

British hurdler Sarah Claxton is confident she can win her first major medal at next month's European Indoor Championships in Madrid.

The 25-year-old has already smashed the British record over 60m hurdles twice this season, setting a new mark of 7.96 seconds to win the AAAs title. ""I am quite confident,"" said Claxton. ""But I take each race as it comes. ""As long as I keep up my training but not do too much I think there is a chance of a medal."" Claxton has won the national 60m hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage. Now, the Scotland-born athlete owns the equal fifth-fastest time in the world this year. And at last week's Birmingham Grand Prix, Claxton left European medal favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko trailing in sixth spot.

For the first time, Claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain her leap in form. In previous seasons, the 25-year-old also contested the long jump but since moving from Colchester to London she has re-focused her attentions. Claxton will see if her new training regime pays dividends at the European Indoors which take place on 5-6 March.
